# Arduino-Gamepad
A USB gamepad made from an Arduino Pro Micro that I developed into a soldering workshop in the Fall of 2020 to Fall 2021.

# Description
This workshop allows attendees to make their own game controller out of an Arduino, custom PCBs, buttons, and a joystick. It will teach about soldering, specifically through hole soldering. We use custom PCBs to elimnate the need for wires and make it eaiser for first solderers. It will also introduce the participants to Arduino code and libraries, although they will not code, it is important to do a quick overview of the code so that they understand why their game controller works. The goal of this workshop is to introduce attendees to Arduinos, soldering, solder safety, PCBs, and for them to walk away with a cool game controller that they personally made.

# Assembly Steps
1. Place Arduino header pins and arduino on PCB.
2. Flip over PCB so that you can solder the header pins to the PCB board.
3. Solder header pins to Arduino.
9. Solder joystick.
10. Solder female header pin extender.
11. Solder buttons onto Button PCB.
12. Solder header pin, with long side on the bottom to the Button PCB.
13. Put the two PCBs together.
14. Check circuit and upload code to test
15. Create/put in casing
16. Once in case test again to make sure everything is operational
