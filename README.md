# Arduino-Gamepad
A USB gamepad made from an Arduino Pro Micro that I developed into a soldering workshop in the Fall of 2020.

# Description
This workshop allows attendees to make their own game controller out of an Arduino, stripboard, buttons, joystick, and wires. It will teach about soldering, specifically soldering header pins to a stripboard. A stripboard will allow for less use of wires and soldering as well as allow attendees to see how fast prototyping can be accomplished using a stripboard. It will also introduce them to Arduino code and libraries, although they will not code, it is important to do a quick overview of the code so that they understand why their game controller works. The goal of this workshop is to introduce attendees to Arduinos, soldering, solder safety, stripboards, and for them to walk away with a cool game controller that they personally made.

# Prototypes

# Assembly Steps
1. Solder header pins to Arduino Pro Micro
2. Cut wires to appropriate length
3. Cut stripboards to appropriate size (One large and one small) (Follow the cut tracks)
4. Cut stripboard tracks
5. Place Arduino in correct position on stripboard
6. Solder Arduino
7. Solder buttons to stripboard
8. Solder wire for buttons and for the joystick (Follow the layout)
9. Solder joystick to the wires (Follow the layout)
10. Check circuit and upload code to test
11. Create/put in casing
12. Once in case test again to make sure everything is operational

# Future Project Plans
1. Make it easier to follow by creating a custom PCB instead of using stripboards and wires
